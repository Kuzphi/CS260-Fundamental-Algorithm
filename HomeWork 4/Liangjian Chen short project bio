Liangjian Chen short project bio
His name is Liangjian Chen, now pursuing a computer science Ph.D. degree in University of California, Irvine. Back in college, he began his first research program in sophomore year. which is about Bayesian network structure learning. Basically, it is a research about construct Bayesian network according to nodes' mutual information. Then in spring of 2015, he attend another Machine learning competition, which is classify the news. In this competition, he was in charge of designing both feature and the classification algorithm. In 2015.8, he began working on variational inference based sequential learning. It is a program that applied variational encode into bidirectional LSTM to make LSTM have a better performance on action recognition.
